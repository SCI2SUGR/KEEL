  <p><b>Graph Management</b></p>

</div>

<p>The graph allows performing the following operations over its elements:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Context menu</b>: it is possible to access to the context menu by double clicking on a certain node in the draw area. This menu depends on the selected object and allows us to remove objects, to configure algorithms parameters, etc...</li>
	
	<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/management1.jpg"></p> 
 
	<li><b>Objects selection</b>: in order to select a single element, just click with the left button of the mouse over it. But it is possible to select several elements, clicking in an empty zone of the draw area and dragging the mouse until covering all the objects wished.</li> 

	<li><b>Move objects</b>: It is possible to move one or several elements selected with the aid of the left button of the mouse, dragging them to the desired position. Another way is to use the keyboard cursors.</li>

	<li><b>Remove objects</b>: To remove a module, select it and press <em>Supr</em> key. It is also possible to remove it by the context menu, of from the tool bar.</li>
</ol>
