<pre>public class <span class="typeNameLabel">PrintfFormat</span>
extends java.lang.Object</pre>
<div class="block">PrintfFormat allows the formatting of an array of
 objects embedded within a string.  Primitive types
 must be passed using wrapper types.  The formatting
 is controlled by a control string.
<p>
 A control string is a Java string that contains a
 control specification.  The control specification
 starts at the first percent sign (%) in the string,
 provided that this percent sign
<ol>
<li>is not escaped protected by a matching % or is
 not an escape % character,
<li>is not at the end of the format string, and
<li>precedes a sequence of characters that parses as
 a valid control specification.
</ol>
</p><p>
 A control specification usually takes the form:
<pre> % ['-+ #0]* [0..9]* { . [0..9]* }+
                { [hlL] }+ [idfgGoxXeEcs]
</pre>
 There are variants of this basic form that are
 discussed below.</p>
<p>
 The format is composed of zero or more directives
 defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>ordinary characters, which are simply copied to
 the output stream;
<li>escape sequences, which represent non-graphic
 characters; and
<li>conversion specifications,  each of which
 results in the fetching of zero or more arguments.
</ul></p>
<p>
 The results are undefined if there are insufficient
 arguments for the format.  Usually an unchecked
 exception will be thrown.  If the format is
 exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
 arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.
 In format strings containing the % form of
 conversion specifications, each argument in the
 argument list is used exactly once.</p>
 <p>
 Conversions can be applied to the <code>n</code>th
 argument after the format in the argument list,
 rather than to the next unused argument.  In this
 case, the conversion characer % is replaced by the
 sequence %<code>n</code>$, where <code>n</code> is
 a decimal integer giving the position of the
 argument in the argument list.</p>
 <p>
 In format strings containing the %<code>n</code>$
 form of conversion specifications, each argument
 in the argument list is used exactly once.</p>

<h4>Escape Sequences</h4>
<p>
 The following table lists escape sequences and
 associated actions on display devices capable of
 the action.
<table>
<tr><th align=left>Sequence</th>
    <th align=left>Name</th>
    <th align=left>Description</th></tr>

          the user through audible or visible
          notification.

<tr><td>\b</td><td>backspace</td><td>Moves the
          printing position to one column before
          the current position, unless the
          current position is the start of a line.

          position to the next implementation-
          defined horizontal tab position.

          printing position to the start of the
          next implementation-defined vertical
          tab position.
</td></tr>
</table></p>
<h4>Conversion Specifications</h4>
<p>
 Each conversion specification is introduced by
 the percent sign character (%).  After the character
 %, the following appear in sequence:</p>
<p>
 Zero or more flags (in any order), which modify the
 meaning of the conversion specification.</p>
<p>
 An optional minimum field width.  If the converted
 value has fewer characters than the field width, it
 will be padded with spaces by default on the left;
 t will be padded on the right, if the left-
 adjustment flag (-), described below, is given to
 the field width.  The field width takes the form
 of a decimal integer.  If the conversion character
 is s, the field width is the the minimum number of
 characters to be printed.</p>
<p>
 An optional precision that gives the minumum number
 of digits to appear for the d, i, o, x or X
 conversions (the field is padded with leading
 zeros); the number of digits to appear after the
 radix character for the e, E, and f conversions,
 the maximum number of significant digits for the g
 and G conversions; or the maximum number of
 characters to be written from a string is s and S
 conversions.  The precision takes the form of an
 optional decimal digit string, where a null digit
 string is treated as 0.  If a precision appears
 with a c conversion character the precision is
 ignored.
 </p>
<p>
 An optional h specifies that a following d, i, o,
 x, or X conversion character applies to a type
 short argument (the argument will be promoted
 according to the integral promotions and its value
 converted to type short before printing).</p>
<p>
 An optional l (ell) specifies that a following
 d, i, o, x, or X conversion character applies to a
 type long argument.</p>
<p>
 A field width or precision may be indicated by an
 asterisk (*) instead of a digit string.  In this
 case, an integer argument supplised the field width
 precision.  The argument that is actually converted
 is not fetched until the conversion letter is seen,
 so the the arguments specifying field width or
 precision must appear before the argument (if any)
 to be converted.  If the precision argument is
 negative, it will be changed to zero.  A negative
 field width argument is taken as a - flag, followed
 by a positive field width.</p>
 <p>
 In format strings containing the %<code>n</code>$
 form of a conversion specification, a field width
 or precision may be indicated by the sequence
 *<code>m</code>$, where m is a decimal integer
 giving the position in the argument list (after the
 format argument) of an integer argument containing
 the field width or precision.</p>
 <p>
 The format can contain either numbered argument
 specifications (that is, %<code>n</code>$ and
 *<code>m</code>$), or unnumbered argument
 specifications (that is % and *), but normally not
 both.  The only exception to this is that %% can
 be mixed with the %<code>n</code>$ form.  The
 results of mixing numbered and unnumbered argument
 specifications in a format string are undefined.</p>

<h4>Flag Characters</h4>
<p>
 The flags and their meanings are:</p>
<dl>
 <dt>'<dd> integer portion of the result of a
      decimal conversion (%i, %d, %f, %g, or %G) will
      be formatted with thousands' grouping
      characters.  For other conversions the flag
      is ignored.  The non-monetary grouping
      character is used.
 <dt>-<dd> result of the conversion is left-justified
      within the field.  (It will be right-justified
      if this flag is not specified).</td></tr>
 <dt>+<dd> result of a signed conversion always
      begins with a sign (+ or -).  (It will begin
      with a sign only when a negative value is
      converted if this flag is not specified.)
 <dt>&lt;space&gt;<dd> If the first character of a
      signed conversion is not a sign, a space
      character will be placed before the result.
      This means that if the space character and +
      flags both appear, the space flag will be
      ignored.
 <dt>#<dd> value is to be converted to an alternative
      form.  For c, d, i, and s conversions, the flag
      has no effect.  For o conversion, it increases
      the precision to force the first digit of the
      result to be a zero.  For x or X conversion, a
      non-zero result has 0x or 0X prefixed to it,
      respectively.  For e, E, f, g, and G
      conversions, the result always contains a radix
      character, even if no digits follow the radix
      character (normally, a decimal point appears in
      the result of these conversions only if a digit
      follows it).  For g and G conversions, trailing
      zeros will not be removed from the result as
      they normally are.
 <dt>0<dd> d, i, o, x, X, e, E, f, g, and G
      conversions, leading zeros (following any
      indication of sign or base) are used to pad to
      the field width;  no space padding is
      performed.  If the 0 and - flags both appear,
      the 0 flag is ignored.  For d, i, o, x, and X
      conversions, if a precision is specified, the
      0 flag will be ignored. For c conversions,
      the flag is ignored.
</dl>

<h4>Conversion Characters</h4>
<p>
 Each conversion character results in fetching zero
 or more arguments.  The results are undefined if
 there are insufficient arguments for the format.
 Usually, an unchecked exception will be thrown.
 If the format is exhausted while arguments remain,
 the excess arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>
 The conversion characters and their meanings are:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>d,i<dd>The int argument is converted to a
        signed decimal in the style [-]dddd.  The
        precision specifies the minimum number of
        digits to appear;  if the value being
        converted can be represented in fewer
        digits, it will be expanded with leading
        zeros.  The default precision is 1.  The
        result of converting 0 with an explicit
        precision of 0 is no characters.
 <dt>o<dd> The int argument is converted to unsigned
        octal format in the style ddddd.  The
        precision specifies the minimum number of
        digits to appear;  if the value being
        converted can be represented in fewer
        digits, it will be expanded with leading
        zeros.  The default precision is 1.  The
        result of converting 0 with an explicit
        precision of 0 is no characters.
 <dt>x<dd> The int argument is converted to unsigned
        hexadecimal format in the style dddd;  the
        letters abcdef are used.  The precision
        specifies the minimum numberof digits to
        appear; if the value being converted can be
        represented in fewer digits, it will be
        expanded with leading zeros.  The default
        precision is 1.  The result of converting 0
        with an explicit precision of 0 is no
        characters.
 <dt>X<dd> Behaves the same as the x conversion
        character except that letters ABCDEF are
        used instead of abcdef.
 <dt>f<dd> The floating point number argument is
        written in decimal notation in the style
        [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
        the radix character (shown here as a decimal
        point) is equal to the precision
        specification.  A Locale is used to determine
        the radix character to use in this format.
        If the precision is omitted from the
        argument, six digits are written after the
        radix character;  if the precision is
        explicitly 0 and the # flag is not specified,
        no radix character appears.  If a radix
        character appears, at least 1 digit appears
        before it.  The value is rounded to the
        appropriate number of digits.
 <dt>e,E<dd>The floating point number argument is
        written in the style [-]d.ddde{+-}dd
        (the symbols {+-} indicate either a plus or
        minus sign), where there is one digit before
        the radix character (shown here as a decimal
        point) and the number of digits after it is
        equal to the precision.  A Locale is used to
        determine the radix character to use in this
        format.  When the precision is missing, six
        digits are written after the radix character;
        if the precision is 0 and the # flag is not
        specified, no radix character appears.  The
        E conversion will produce a number with E
        instead of e introducing the exponent.  The
        exponent always contains at least two digits.
        However, if the value to be written requires
        an exponent greater than two digits,
        additional exponent digits are written as
        necessary.  The value is rounded to the
        appropriate number of digits.
 <dt>g,G<dd>The floating point number argument is
        written in style f or e (or in sytle E in the
        case of a G conversion character), with the
        precision specifying the number of
        significant digits.  If the precision is
        zero, it is taken as one.  The style used
        depends on the value converted:  style e
        (or E) will be used only if the exponent
        resulting from the conversion is less than
        -4 or greater than or equal to the precision.
        Trailing zeros are removed from the result.
        A radix character appears only if it is
        followed by a digit.
 <dt>c,C<dd>The integer argument is converted to a
        char and the result is written.

 <dt>s,S<dd>The argument is taken to be a string and
        bytes from the string are written until the
        end of the string or the number of bytes
        indicated by the precision specification of
        the argument is reached.  If the precision
        is omitted from the argument, it is taken to
        be infinite, so all characters up to the end
        of the string are written.
 <dt>%<dd>Write a % character;  no argument is
        converted.
</dl>
<p>
 If a conversion specification does not match one of
 the above forms, an IllegalArgumentException is
 thrown and the instance of PrintfFormat is not
 created.</p>
<p>
 If a floating point value is the internal
 representation for infinity, the output is
 [+]Infinity, where Infinity is either Infinity or
 Inf, depending on the desired output string length.
 Printing of the sign follows the rules described
 above.</p>
<p>
 If a floating point value is the internal
 representation for "not-a-number," the output is
 [+]NaN.  Printing of the sign follows the rules
 described above.</p>
<p>
 In no case does a non-existent or small field width
 cause truncation of a field;  if the result of a
 conversion is wider than the field width, the field
 is simply expanded to contain the conversion result.
</p>
<p>
 The behavior is like printf.  One exception is that
 the minimum number of exponent digits is 3 instead
 of 2 for e and E formats when the optional L is used
 before the e, E, g, or G conversion character.  The
 optional L does not imply conversion to a long long
 double. </p>
 <p>
 The biggest divergence from the C printf
 specification is in the use of 16 bit characters.
 This allows the handling of characters beyond the
 small ASCII character set and allows the utility to
 interoperate correctly with the rest of the Java
 runtime environment.</p>
<p>
 Omissions from the C printf specification are
 numerous.  All the known omissions are present
 because Java never uses bytes to represent
 characters and does not have pointers:</p>
<ul>
 <li>%c is the same as %C.
 <li>%s is the same as %S.
 <li>u, p, and n conversion characters.
 <li>%ws format.
 <li>h modifier applied to an n conversion character.
 <li>l (ell) modifier applied to the c, n, or s
 conversion characters.
 <li>ll (ell ell) modifier to d, i, o, u, x, or X
 conversion characters.
 <li>ll (ell ell) modifier to an n conversion
 character.
 <li>c, C, d,i,o,u,x, and X conversion characters
 apply to Byte, Character, Short, Integer, Long
 types.
 <li>f, e, E, g, and G conversion characters apply
 to Float and Double types.
 <li>s and S conversion characters apply to String
 types.
 <li>All other reference types can be formatted
 using the s or S conversion characters only.
</ul>
 <p>
 Most of this specification is quoted from the Unix
 man page for the sprintf utility.</p></div>
