		<howWork>Automatic Branch and Bound algorithm starts with a full set of features, and removes one feature at a time. If 
			the full set contains three features, the root is (1 1 1) where ‘1’ means presence of the corresponding 
			feature and ‘0’ its absence. Its child nodes are (1 1 0), (1 0 1), and (0 1 1), etc. When there is 
			no restriction on expanding nodes in the search space, this could lead to an exhaustive 
			search. However, if each node is evaluated by a measure U and an upper limit is set for 
			the acceptable values of U , then Branch and Bound backtracks whenever an infeasible 
			node is discovered. If U is monotonic, no feasible node is omitted as a result of 
			early backtracking and, therefore, savings in search time do not sacrifice the 
			optimality of the selected subset, and hence it is a non-exhaustive yet complete 
			search. This algorithm uses the concept of approximate monotonicity which means 
			that branch and bound can continue even after encountering a node that does not satisfy 
			the bound. But the node that finally is accepted must satisfy the set bound.
