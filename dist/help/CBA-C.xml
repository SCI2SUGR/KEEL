		<type>Classification model by association rules.</type>

		<objective>To integrate two mining techniques (association rule mining and classification rule mining) by mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs).</objective>

		<howWork>
			This method proposes an integration between association rule mining and classification rule mining by means an efficient way such as it does not suffer a loss of performance (accuracy of the resultant classifier).
			The integration is done by focusing on a special subset of association rules whose right-hand-side are restricted to the classification class attribute (Class Association Rules, CARs).
			Data mining in the proposed associative classification framework consists of three steps:
			
				* discretizing continuous attributes, if any 
					In this implementation we employ a previous Fayyad Discretization on the values.
					
				* generating all the class association rules (CARs) [CBA-RuleGenerator]
						The basis here is to find all "ruleitems" that have support above a minimum threshold "minsup".
						A ruleitem is of the form [condset,y] where "condset" is a set of items (pairs [attribute,value]) and "y" is a class label.
						The support count of the "condset" is the number of cases (examples) in D that contain the condset.
						The support count of the "ruleitem" is the number of cases in D that contain the condset an are labeled with class "y".
						Example:
							We have 10 examples, two of them are
							[{(A,1),(B,1)},(class: 1)] condsupCount:3, rulesupCount:2
							[{(A,1),(B,1)},(class: 2)] condsupCount:3, rulesupCount:1
							Those are two ruleitems with the same condset (and of course, the same support count of the condset).
							However, if we set a minimum support threshold of 20%, we just accept the first one and we will say that it is frequent.
							Also, if the rule's confidence (computed as rulesupCount/condsupCount*100) is higher than a minimum given threshold, we will say it is accurate.
						Therefore, the set of class association rules (CARs) thus consists of all the possible rules (PRs) that are both frequent and accurate.
				
				* pruning CARs (optional)
					We can reduce the number of rules by using the pessimistic error rate based pruning method used in C4.5.
					
				* building a classifier based on the generated CARs [CBA-ClassifierBuilder]
					The basic idea of the algorithm is to choose a set of high precedence rules in Rulebase to cover the whole training dataset.
					A rule has higher "a" precedence than other "b" if:
						1. confidence of a is greater than that of b
						2. same confidence but support of a is greater than that of b
						3. same confidence and support but a is generated earlier.
					Our classifier is of the following format:
						[rule1,rule2,rule3,...,ruleN, defaultClass]
					The basic steps are:
						Step1: Sort the set of generated rules acoding to the precedence order
						Step2: Select rules for the classifier from the set following the sorted sequence by selecting those rules which cover examples.
						Step3: Discard those rules in C that do not improve the accuracy of the classifier.
