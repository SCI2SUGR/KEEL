		<type>Classification model by association rules.</type>

		<objective>The CBA2 method is an upgrade of CBA method which improve the previous system by using multiple class "minsups" in rule generation.</objective>

		<howWork>
			 The CBA2 method improves CBA by using multiple class "minsups" in rule generation (i.e. each class is assigned a different minsup), rather than using only a single minsup as in CBA.
			 CBA2 works exactly in the same way of the previous CBA system, except for a new function int the CBA data mining system (CBA-RuleGenerator) where it uses multiple minimum class supports.
			 For each class ci, a different minimum class support is assigned. The user only gives a total minsup, denoted by t_minsup, which is distributed to each class according to their class distributions as follows:
				minsupi = t_minsup x freqDistr(ci)
			The formula gives frequent classes higher minsups and infrequent classes lower minsups.
			This ensures that we will generate sufficient rules for infrequent classes and will not produce too many overfitting rules for frequent classes.
		</howWork>

			<param>MinSupport = Is the threshold for the support value to create the items.</param>
			<param>MinConfidence = Is the threshold for the confidence value to create the rules.</param>
			<param>Wether_pruning_rules_or_not = Parameter to establish wether we will use a pruned version of the RuleSet (prCAR) [value:1] to classify or not (CAR) [value:0].</param>
			<param>Limit_Rules = Is the maximum number of rules to be generated. It is useful for extremelly large databases where the number of generated rules could be impossible to manage. (Value:0 means no limit of rules) </param>
