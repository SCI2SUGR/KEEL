		<type>Classification model by association rules.</type>

		<objective>To combine the advantages of both associative classification and traditional rule-based classification by adopting a greedy algorithm to generate rules directly from training data.</objective>

		<howWork>
			CPAR inherits the basic idea of FOIL in rule generation and integrates the features of associative classification in predictive rule analysis.
			The algorithm CPAR uses a
			Moreover, CPAR employs the following features to further improve its accuracy and efficiency:
				(1) CPAR uses dynamic programming to avoid repeated calculation in rule generation; and 
				(2) when generating rules, instead of selecting only the best literal, all the close-to-the-best literals are selected so that important rules will not be missed.
			In PRM (Predictive Rule Mining), every rule is generated from the remaining dataset.
			Suppose an example t in the remaining dataset is covered by a rule r that is just generated. We are not sure whether r is the best rule for t because
				(1) r is generated by greedy algorithm; and 
				(2) r is generated from the remaining dataset instead of the whole dataset.
			In PRM, we also generate at least a certain number of rules for each example (depending on the weight decay factor "alpha"). However, these several rules are not necessarily the best rules for the reasons illustrated above.
			
			Here, CPAR is proposed. It stands in the middle between exhaustive and greedy algorithms and combines the advantages of both.
			CPAR builds rules by adding literals one by one, which is similar to PRM. However, instead of ignoring all literals except the best one, CPAR keeps all close-to-the-best literals during the rule building process.
			By doing so, CPAR can select more than one literal at the same time and build several rules simultaneously.
