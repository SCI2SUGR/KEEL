		<type>Classification model by boosted decision trees to use in imbalanced environments</type>

		<objective>To determine a decision tree that on the basis of answers to questions about the input attributes predicts correctly the value of the target attribute.
                The cost set-ups are taken into account in the boosting procedure.</objective>

		<howWork> AdaC2 is a boosting algorithm that produce an ensemble of decision trees (C4.5 in this case) from a set of given examples. Each instance
                has an associated cost depending on the class. It tries to solve the imbalance problem by increasing the weight of the instances from the minority
                class in each iteration of the boosting algorithm.

                It can be executed using the cost sensitive C4.5 or a resampling procedure after the weights update.

		<parameterSpec>  

			<param>prune: is to prune or not prune the tree. It is a boolean value that determines if the algorithm applies a prune process after building the tree</param>
			<param>confidence: is the confidence level. It is a float value that determines what is the minimal confidence that must has a leaf in order to can be considered in the tree</param>
			<param>minItemsets is the minimum number of item-sets per leaf. It is an integer value that determines how much data instances must contain a leaf in order to can be created</param>
			<param>Number of Classifiers: is the maximum number of iterations that the boosting procedure will be executed</param>
                        <param>Train Method: is the method used to train the classifier in each iteration (using resampling or cost-sensitive classifier)</param>
                        <param>Cost Set-up: is the cost set-up, when ADAPTIVE the costs are selected considering the imbalance ratio, in other case they are manually set.</param>
                        <param>Cost Majority class: is the cost for missclassifying an instance from the majority class (if set-up is MANUAL).</param>
                        <param>Cost Minority class: is the cost for missclassifying an instance from the minority class (if set-up is MANUAL).</param>
