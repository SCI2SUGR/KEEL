		<type>Non Evolutionary Wrapper Stochastic method</type>

		<objective>Feature Selection. This method allows search to follow feature subsets that are randomly generated</objective>

		<howWork>LVW initializes a set to the empty set. It will load the subset of features selected and obtain a precision rate classifying using all features of the input dataset

Next, it starts a loop MaxLoops times.

Firstable it generates a random subset of features. Secondly, if the precision rate obtained classifying using only the selected features is better than the previously best, the new best subset will be this subset (the last generated).
</howWork>

		<parameterSpec>  
			<param>maxLoops: is the maximum number of loops. Generally, it is a number linked to the number of original features N.  The rule of thumb is that the more features in the data, the more difficult it is for feature selection. Normally the value chosen is c*N, where c is a constant.
				We can start c whit some number (e.g. 77) or simply make it as N2. In general, the larger maxLoops is, the better solution can expect.
				Another more reasonable way os setting maxLoops is to link to the space the user wants to cover. The complete space is 2N, if the user wants to cover p% of the space, he can set maxLoops = 2N * p%.</param>
			<param>paramKNN: is the number of nearest neighbours used by the k-NN classifier</param>
